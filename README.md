<b>snorkel</b> is a real time data analysis  tool,  meant  to  answer  questions
about the *now*.  At its heart, snorkel is built on  the  idea  that  iterative
analysis is key to understanding.  In other words - when graphs move, it  should
be easy to drill down on what is happening and why, not a frustrating  exercise
in adjusting failed queries.

future plans
------------

**2018 Q4 Update**: After 5 years in the node ecosystem, I will be moving
snorkel to a python backend. Expect a new release in Q1 2019. I feel that the
node ecosystem has too much churn - it is difficult for me to make a package
that can be installed without problems or security issues and I would like
snorkel to have a lasting lifetime.

The new snorkel will have the same UI and retain many of the same features as
the current snorkel. Some advantages will be:

* adding new views will be easier for everyone
* code configured datasets
* less external dependencies
* package stability

[grafana snorkel datasource](https://github.com/logV/grafana-snorkel-datasource) is a plugin for grafana (3.0) to query snorkel. While this plugin is in early stages, grafana is quite amazing.
